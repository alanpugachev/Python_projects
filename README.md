1.Telegram bot
  An unfinished project of a bot for the telegram messenger. Initially, it was developed as a bot for creating a news feed due to the lack of such in the messenger itself. The     project is frozen due to the lack of the necessary tools in the aiogram python library.

  Further processing is planned using the Telegram-API.

  The project was built with VS Code.
